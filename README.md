# CSCI150-Library-Assignment
README initialization
This project provides a custom string manipulation library, offering basic tools to work with strings without relying on Python's built-in string methods. The library includes functions for checking if characters are alphabetic or numeric, converting cases, finding substrings, and replacing characters or substrings. It is designed to give users insight into fundamental string operations by implementing them manually.
